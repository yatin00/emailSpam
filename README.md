# Intelligent Spam Detection and Classification

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building an **automated spam detection system** using machine learning and natural language processing techniques. The system can classify messages (e.g., emails, SMS) as **spam** or **not spam**, helping improve communication security and reduce unwanted content.

## Features
- Preprocessing of raw text data (cleaning, tokenization, normalization)
- Feature extraction using **TF-IDF** or word embeddings
- Classification models such as **Naive Bayes**, **Random Forest**, or **BERT**
- Evaluation using metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
- Visualization of results with confusion matrix and performance charts
